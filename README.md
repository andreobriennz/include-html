# include-html

**Important note: this project is intended for quick prototypes of small projects. It isn't performance optimised or safe for handling user input**

## Basic Feature
Simply create an HTML element with a data-include attribute, and make the value of the attribute equal the path to the file you want to include: 

```
<div data-include="path/to/file.html"></div>
```
